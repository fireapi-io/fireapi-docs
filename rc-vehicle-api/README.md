## 🧠 What is RTO Vehicle Details API?

- Vehicle registration (RC) status  
- Owner details  
- Insurance status & provider  
- Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUC) validity  
- Registration authority (RTO office)

## 📄 Why This API Matters

In India, vehicle registration and compliance data are maintained by government systems like **VAHAN** and **mParivahan**. This API lets you:

- **Verify RC authenticity** before onboarding a vehicle  
- **Check insurance & PUC status** to ensure compliance  
- **Automate verification workflows** for faster business processes  
- **Reduce fraud and manual errors** in vehicle-based services  

Traditional manual checks (like going to Parivahan portals or mobile apps) are slow and non-scalable — this API brings real-time data to your applications. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
